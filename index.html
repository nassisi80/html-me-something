      I really wasn't sure what to come up with for this assignment, but as I was working on it I couldn't help but listen to the rumbling noises
      coming from my stomach...and then I had the sparkle...PASTA! That led me to the idea for this simple webpage. 
      <br>Being born in Italy, but having lived in the US for 13 years now, one thing that I was never able to get over was the misconceptions about
      pretty much 98% of italian food being served coast to coast in this country.So I though I would populate this page with a few simple and quick
      recipes of my favorite italian pasta dishes. What else can I say if not.... Buon Appetito Launchcoders of Miami!!!

      <p> Sugo or salsa all'amatriciana is a traditional Italian pasta sauce based on guanciale (cured pork cheek), pecorino cheese from Amatrice, tomato, 
        and, in some variations, onion. Originating from the town of Amatrice (in the mountainous Province of Rieti of Lazio region), the Amatriciana is 
        one of the best known pasta sauces in Roman and Italian cuisine. The Italian government has named it a traditional agro-alimentary product of Lazio.

            <li class="rec"i>Dice the guanciale into medium pieces, cubes of about 1/2 inch. Be wary of dicing the meat too small, if so it will be easier to overcook and you are aiming for tender rather than crispy.</li>
            <li class="rec">Sautee the guanciale and hot pepper in the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. As soon as the fat becomes translucent, remove the meat and set to drain on a paper towel.</li>
            <li class="rec">Add onions to the rendered fat and sautee, stirring constantly, until translucent. Add the tomatoes and the guanciale. Simmer on low heat about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li class="rec">When the water comes to a boil, add the pasta. Traditionally you use bucatini or spaghetti, though rigatoni is also an excellent partner for amatriciana. Cook the pasta 1 minute less than the package states. Drain the pasta and add it to the pan with the sauce. Toss with the sauce and add the pecorino romano, stirring constantly so that the melted cheese coats the pasta. Remove from heat and serve immediately with additional grated pecorino for sprinkling on top. </li>

      <p> Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with egg, hard cheese, guanciale (or pancetta), and pepper.
        The recipe is not fixed by a specific type of hard cheese or pasta. The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano. Spaghetti is the usual pasta, however, 
        fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Either guanciale or pancetta can be used. Another common substitute outside Italy is lardons 
        of smoked bacon. The dish was created in the middle of the 20th century.</p></td>

      <p> Pesto is derived from the Italian verb pestare, to grind or crush. Created in the port city Genova, true pesto genovese is comprised of freshly-ground basil under the certification genovese DOP (Denominazione Origine Protetta, or protected designation of origin), Ligurian extra virgin olive oil, pine nuts, sea salt, and garlic. Many varieties also include Parmigiano Reggiano and Fiore Sardo (because you can never go wrong by adding cheese).
          When preparing the perfect plate of pasta, our chefs at Eataly remind us that the pasta should &quot;marry&quot; the sauce. The shape, size, and texture of each type of pasta interact differently with various sauces. Pesto&#39;s match made in pasta heaven is trofie, a twisted, spiral-shaped pasta that is also native to Liguria. The ribbed spirals perfectly pick up pesto's fine consistency, resulting in perfect bite after perfect bite, each guaranteed to transport you to the Ligurian seaside.</p></td>

      <p> Spaghetti alle vongole, Italian for spaghetti with clams, is a dish that is very popular throughout Italy, especially in Campania (where it is part of traditional Neapolitan cuisine).
          In the Liguria region of Italy, east of Genoa, Spaghetti alle vongole (veraci) means spaghetti with tiny baby clams in the shell, no more than the size of a thumbnail, with a white wine/garlic sauce. Linguine also may be used for the pasta in preference to spaghetti. </p>
